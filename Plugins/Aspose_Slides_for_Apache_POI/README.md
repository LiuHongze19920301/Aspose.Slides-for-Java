## Aspose.Slides Java for Apache POI SL

Aspose.Slides Java for Apache POI SL is a project to provide comparative source code examples to do the same file processing tasks using Aspose for Java APIs and Apache POI. Additionally, this project provides source code examples for advanced features offered by Aspose which are missing in Apache POI.

Below are some code comparisons and features of Aspose.Slides for Java that are not available in Apache POI

## Why Aspose for Apache POI ?

The developers looking for file format libraries may need to walk through the features provided by the libraries available on the market. Mainly, two factors are considered when choosing an option:

* Features
* Efforts required to use the library

If you are a Java developer looking to choose a file format library to process word files, you may want to compare Apache POI SL SDK with Aspose.Slides for Java. In this case, this project will help you to compare features and code in both libraries. Please visit project documentation for a comprehensive comparison.

## What is Apache POI ?

The Apache POI Project's mission is to create and maintain Java APIs for manipulating various file formats based upon the Office Open XML standards (OOXML) and Microsoft's OLE 2 Compound Document format (OLE2). In short, you can read and write MS Excel files using Java. In addition, you can read and write MS Word and MS PowerPoint files using Java. Apache POI is Java Excel solution (for Excel 97-2008).

OLE2 files include Microsoft Office files such as XLS, DOC, and PPT as well as MFC serialization API based file formats. The project provides APIs for the OLE2 Filesystem (POIFS) and OLE2 Document Properties (HPSF).

Office OpenXML Format is the new standards based XML file format found in Microsoft Office 2007 and 2008. This includes XLSX, DOCX and PPTX. The project provides a low level API to support the Open Packaging Conventions using openxml4j.

For each MS Office application there exists a component module that attempts to provide a common high level Java api to both OLE2 and OOXML document formats.
